# QButterfly
QButterfly is a lightweight approach to embed websites into Qualtrics surveys and observe user behavior. It can be used to track user behavior on single websites or in online experiments (e.g. in controlled usability experiments). 

Qualtrics is used to conveniently manage the overall study flow including consent, random assignment of participants to treatments, manipulation checks, etc. The stimulus website is embedded into Qualtrics via an iframe. Currently, Butterfly can track only user clicks on a stimulus website. Clicks are then stored in a Qualtrics question and can be easily analyzed afterwards. It is therefore not required to manually match a users's survey inputs with other behavioral data (e.g., server logs, analytics tools) after the survey.
